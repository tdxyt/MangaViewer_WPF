# MangaViewer_WPF
An old simple image viewer with some author-preferred modes for reading comic.
It was originally programmed in VB a decade ago and not intended to open source, here trying to migrate to WPF.
Codes are programmed in casual style and less commented with few .NET expirence, 
thus RAM wasting and limited in functions.
